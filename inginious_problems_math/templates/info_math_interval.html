"This problem type is designed for intervals
such as [0,2]∪[5,∞).
If you want an equation or a matrix...
Please refer to other problem types.

Notes:
The [] symbols represent inclusion and ()
symbols represent exclusion.
As a convention, we advise to always
exclude infinity.

It is advised to only ask for a single answer for this
problem type. If you want, for example, 2 domains for 2
different functions, please create two subproblems."

"e always represents the basis of natural logarithms.
i always represents the imaginary constant.
Do not use these letters to represent variables.

log means log base 10.
ln means natural logarithm.
log_a means log with base a.

Decimals are represented using .
Separations are represented using ,

When a letter is followed by an opening parenthesis,
it is interpreted as \"function of...\"
For example, x(2y+3) means x evaluated at 2y+3
If you want a multiplication instead,
use x*(2y+3) or (2y+3)x.
This helps differentiate variables and functions."
